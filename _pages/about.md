I am an senior engineer at a dot-com company. I received my master's degree from NUAA in 2020. My research interests include large language models, AI agents and embodied artificial intelligence.

Research Interests
======
- Large Language Models, especially on the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for reasoning, planning, and execution, focusing on the controllability, interpretability, and efficiency of LLMs. Self-reflective, self-improving and self-evolving LLMs are also of interest.
- AI Agents, especially on autonomous agents, multi-agent systems, and human-agent collaboration, focusing on the abilities of agents for reasoning, decision-making, and interaction.
